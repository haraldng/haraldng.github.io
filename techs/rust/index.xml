Contrary to other protcols such as Raft or Zab, Omni-Paxos is resilient to partial network partitions and allows for efficient parallel reconfiguration through its decoupled design.
An OmniPaxos replica is implemented as a Rust struct. This should allow for convenient usage with any desired network implementation or on top of an actor framework such as Kompact.</description></item><item><title>The Message-passing Perfomance Suite</title><link>https://example.com/portfolio/kompicsbenches/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 19:47:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/portfolio/kompicsbenches/</guid><description>The Message-passing Perfomance Suite (MPP) is a cross-language benchmark suite for message-passing frameworks. It allows for testing and automated benchmarking of distributed programs in both local and real distributed environments. MPP has been used for benchmarking Kompact and Omni-Paxos.</description></item></channel></rss>
