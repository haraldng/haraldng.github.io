I am a PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I am part of the Division of Software and Computer Systems (SCS) where I am supervised by Prof. [Seif Haridi](https://people.kth.se/~haridi/), Prof. [Jim Dowling](https://www.kth.se/profile/jdowling) and Asst. Prof. [Paris Carbone](https://www.kth.se/profile/parisc).

My research focuses on distributed systems, in particular distributed consensus, fault tolerance, and scalability. My work is closely related to the [Continous Deep Analytics](https://cda-group.github.io/) (CDA) project.
